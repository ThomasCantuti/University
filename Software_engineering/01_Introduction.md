# Introduction to Software Engineering

SWEBOK = Software Engineering Body of Knowledge

## Why Software Engineering?
word “engineering” --> comes from “ingenuity”

resourcefulness of a person to solve the problem

Skills, abilities, and capacities that an individual or a group of individuals possesses to solve a problem

## Software Characteristics
- **Systematic** --> following a clear, organized approach to software development
- **Discipline** --> applying structured and consistent methods throughout software development
- **Quantification** --> measuring and using data to evaluate the software development process

Software development should **follow a “coordinated” approach**

However, there are **some development methodologies** that are **not coordinated (agile)**, which can be chaotic but effective in certain cases

Software is characterized by being:
- methodical
- based on standards
- measurable

## Why Engineering?
**Software development** --> supported by a wide variety of methodologies, standards, organizations, technologies, tools, techniques, and methods that make it an engineering discipline

**Engineering processes** --> applied before, during, and after the development of the product

## Organizations in Software Engineering
- W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
- OMG (Object Management Group)
- ISO (International Organization for Standarization)
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers)
- ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)

**Concepts**:
- **Norm/Normalization (same of standard)**:
    - general rule or guideline that is commonly accepted or followed (defined by RAE - Royal Spanish Academy)
    - organizations: ISO, IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector)
- **Standard/Standardization (same of norm)**:
    - official or formal rule that defines how something should be done
    - organizations: ACM, ISO, IEC, ITU-T, AENOR (Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification) = UNE, CTN (Technical Standardization Committee)
- **Recommendation**:
    - suggestion or advice, usually not mandatory, on how to improve or do something (similar to a norm or standard but free which they often require a fee)
    - organizations: W3C and OMG

**Organizations**:
- **W3C**:
    - Recommendation, Congress: HTML, CSS, XML, etc.
    - create web standards
    - focus: accessibility, privacy, security, internationalization
- **OMG**:
    - Recommendation, Congress: UML (Unified Modeling Language)
    - create object-oriented standards
    - focus: modeling, architecture, software development
- **ISO**:
    - Standard: ISO 9001, ISO 27001
    - durability of Norms
    - focus: systems modernization strategies (because of the durability of norms)
- **IEEE**:
    - Standard: IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)
    - focus: electrical and electronic engineering
    - communities, conferences, publications, education
    - IEEE 730 (standard for software quality assurance): provide unified and minimum requirements for the preparation of software quality assurance plans
- **ACM**:
    - Standard: ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
    - focus: computing and information technology
    - Code of Ethics and Professional Best Practices
    - communities, conferences, publications, education
- **SISTEDES (Society of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies)**:
    - non-profit organization
    - focus: promoting research, innovation, and technology transfer among the various stakeholders involved in the advancement of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies disciplines
    - organizes the annual SISTEDES Scientific Conferences:
        - Software Engineering and Databases (JISBD)
        - Service Science and Engineering (JCIS)
        - Programming and Languages (PROLE)
