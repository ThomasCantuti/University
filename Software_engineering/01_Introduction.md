# Introduction to Software Engineering

SWEBOK = Software Engineering Body of Knowledge

## Why Software Engineering?
word “engineering” --> comes from “ingenuity”

“You have to be resourceful to solve the problem”

“Skills, abilities, and capacities that an individual or a group of individuals possesses to solve a problem”

## Software Characteristics
Software charateristics:
- Systematicity --> Software development activities follow predefined guidelines, adhering to a specific methodology (methodical)
- Discipline --> the software is subject to standard controls during its development, as well as to behavioral guidelines established and known by the members of the group
- Quantification --> both the development process and the resulting product can (or should) be measured, with the aim of improving the quality of the processes used during development and the artifacts produced

Software development should **follow a “coordinated” approach**

However, there are **some development methodologies** that are **not coordinated (agile)**, which can be chaotic but effective in certain cases

Software is characterized by being:
- methodical
- based on standards
- measurable

## Why Engineering?
Software development is supported by a wide variety of methodologies, standards, organizations, technologies, tools, techniques, and methods that make it an engineering discipline.  
Therefore, engineering processes are applied before, during, and after the development of the product.

## Organizations in Software Engineering
- W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
- OMG (Object Management Group)
- ISO (International Organization for Standarization)
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers)
- ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)

**Concepts**:
- **Norm/Normalization**:
    - adjusting several similar things to a common type or norm (defined by RAE - Royal Spanish Academy)
    - organizations: ISO, IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector)
- **Standard/Standardization**:
    - establishes a set of technical specifications or criteria intended to be used consistently as rules or guidelines in a specific context
    - organizations: ACM, ISO, IEC, ITU-T, AENOR (Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification) = UNE, CTN (Technical Standardization Committee)
- **Recommendation**:
    - similar to a norm or standard
    - organizations: W3C and OMG
    - usually free, unlike norms or standards, which often require a fee

**Organizations**:
- **W3C**:
    - Recommendation, Congress: HTML, CSS, XML, etc.
    - create web standards
    - focus: accessibility, privacy, security, internationalization
- **OMG**:
    - Recommendation, Congress: UML (Unified Modeling Language)
    - create object-oriented standards
    - focus: modeling, architecture, software development
- **ISO**:
    - Standard: ISO 9001, ISO 27001
    - durability of Norms
    - focus: systems modernization strategies (because of the durability of norms)
- **IEEE**:
    - Standard: IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)
    - focus: electrical and electronic engineering
    - communities, conferences, publications, education
    - IEEE 730 (standard for software quality assurance): provide unified and minimum requirements for the preparation of software quality assurance plans
- **ACM**:
    - Standard: ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
    - focus: computing and information technology
    - Code of Ethics and Professional Best Practices
    - communities, conferences, publications, education
- **SISTEDES (Society of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies)**:
    - non-profit organization
    - focus: promoting research, innovation, and technology transfer among the various stakeholders involved in the advancement of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies disciplines
    - organizes the annual SISTEDES Scientific Conferences:
        - Software Engineering and Databases (JISBD)
        - Service Science and Engineering (JCIS)
        - Programming and Languages (PROLE)
