# Design

**design definition (IEEE 1990)**:
- process of defining architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component
- result of this process

**main goal** --> specify components, modules, or parts of software and how they communicate

2 main subprocesses of design:
- **architecture design** (or high-level design) --> decompose and organize the system into different components
- **detailed design** --> describe the specific behavior of each software component identified in the previous process

## Fundamental Design Concepts
### Abstraction
- **different levels of detail** --> from high level abstraction to a level of detail closer to implementation
- **3 types**:
    - **data abstraction** --> object as a set of data
    - **procedural abstraction** --> sequence of steps that make up a specific process
    - **control abstraction** --> control system of software without describing the internal workings
- all 3 types used

### Component
functional part of a system that:
- hides how it works inside (implementation details)
- provides its functions through interfaces

it is usually replaceable, self-contained, and can be reused in software design

### Interface
defines how two softwre parts communicate and how one part interacts with the other

### Modularization and Decomposition
- **modularization** --> **divide** a complex problem into smaller **independent** parts/modules and **integrate them** to make it easier to solve
- **properties to evaluate modularity**:
    - **decomposition** --> break down high-level components into lower-level components (can be recursive)
    - **composition** --> reverse of decomposition
    - **understandability** --> easier to design programming elements that can be understood without knowing the rest of the modules
    - **continuity** --> small change in the specification should result in a small change in the system's implementation
    - **protection** --> errors or execution issues should be confined to the module where the error occurred, or affect as few modules as possible in the system
- **measuring modularity**:
    - the goal is to minimize dependencies between modules
    - dependencies are measured using:
        - **coupling** --> level of interconnection between modules (goal -> low coupling)
        - **cohesion** --> how closely the elements within a module are related to performing a common function (goal -> high cohesion)

### System Architecture (ISO/IEC 42010:2007)
fundamental organization of the system represented by:
- components
- relationships between components and the environment
- principles guiding design and implementation

**standard** that provides a general framework to:
- identify stakeholders and their interests
- select and identify viewpoints for the interests
- document the architecture views that satisfy the viewpoints
- document inconsistencies between views
- establish a basis for decisions regarding the architecture

**different approaches** (based on the type of project):
- **functional architecture** --> describes the different functions of the system
    - **vertical or user-functional** --> decomposition based on grouping functionalities derived from functional requirements
    - **cross-functional** --> includes aspects that are not specific to certain functional groups
- **database architecture**
- **hardware and network architecture** that make up the system
- **architectural styles** --> different ways to organize components in a software architecture
    - **filter-pipeline or batch processing** --> a component takes input, processes it, and passes it to another component

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.05.43.png>)

    - **object-oriented** --> system organized using a class diagram

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.08.05.png>)

    - **event-based architecture** --> components send out events, and other components can sign up to be notified when certain events happen

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.07.27.png>)

    - **layered architectures** --> components arranged in layers

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.08.40.png>)

    - **repository or shared data systems** --> central data structure accessed by various components

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.09.02.png>)

    - **process control** --> adds control components (like a feedback loop) to manage the behavior of system components

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.09.21.png>)

    - **distributed processes** --> system's functions split across different machines, common in client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-16 alle 13.10.46.png>)

**architectural languages (ADLs = Architecture Description Languages)**:
- define components, connectors, and communication links in software architectures
- help with verification and rapid prototyping
- **types**:
    - **general-purpose** --> used for various types of software architectures
    - **domain-specific (DSSA = Domain-Specific Software Architectures)** --> tailored for specific domains
- **examples**: ACME, ArTek, Rapide, MetaH, SysML, Darwin, UML, Wright

### Design Notations
- many notations to describe a system's architecture:
    - **structured methods**
    - **object-oriented methods**
    - **mixed options** that combine different notations for different parts of the system
- common notations:
    - object-oriented methods
    - UML as a modeling language
    - databases modeled using entity-relationship diagrams
    - flowcharts or pseudocode to define algorithms
    - prototypes and UI navigation through storyboards

## Design Methods
### Structured Methods
functional decomposition from the complete system down to the necessary level of detail for implementation (based on a top-down approach)

**key aspects**:
- functional decomposition (specification of processes)
- data modeling (specification of data)
- representation of information flow (specification of control)

**Types of structured methods**:
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**
    - represent data flows and the transformations applied to them
    - nodes --> processes
    - vertices --> inputs/outputs of processes
    - can be broken down into sub-diagrams at different levels, following a top-down approach
    - **elements**:
        - **processes** --> describe system functionality
        - **stores** --> define data used by the system
        - **external entities** --> sources or destinations of information
        - **data flows** --> represent communications between system elements
    
    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.39.48.png>)

- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (E/R)**
    - conceptual data modeling
    - focused on designing database schemas
    - **key elements**:
        - **entities (and their attributes)**
        - **relationships**

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.40.55.png>)

- **Data Dictionary**:
    - contains the data used by the system
    - primarily describes the data structure
    - also provides information on restrictions, access, authorizations, transactions, relationships with users, etc.
    - **metadata** (data about the data)

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.42.41.png>)

- **Structure Diagrams**:
    - represent the modular structure of a structured system
    - functional decomposition in a hierarchical manner
    - information about execution sequence, control, and data (sent or received)

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.44.54.png>)

### Structured Methods to Describe Each Module
- **Transition tables**:
    - define rules in a tabular format with actions to be performed
    - rules depend on conditions set by certain input variables

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.50.54.png>)

- **Decision trees**: similar to decision tables but in a tree format

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.54.13.png>)

- **State diagrams**: originally developed to describe finite automata, now used in many areas
    
    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.55.26.png>)

- **Other description methods**: pseudocode, flowcharts, etc.

    ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 16.57.21.png>)

### Data-Oriented Methods
- many systems which manage data
- data organized in files or databases
- E/R model used for analysis and as a starting point in database design

### Object-Oriented Design
- **object-oriented programming languages** share common features and principles
- **object-oriented design methods** have emerged, each with its own tools and notation
- **UML**  --> standard language for modeling, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems based on object-oriented principles

- **properties**:
    - **abstraction** --> simplifies complexity by defining classes that group common properties and actions
    - **inheritance** --> creates new classes based on existing ones, inheriting features and adding new ones
    - **encapsulation** --> organizes data and actions, so users interact only with the public interface without needing to understand the details
    - **polymorphism** --> allows methods with the same name to behave differently

- **UML** --> describe systems using models and diagrams
    - **Model** --> system abstracted view described at an appropriate level of detail
    - **Diagram** --> graphical representation of a model or set of models
        - **structure diagrams** --> describe the systemâ€™s physical (static) structure (e.g. Classes, Objects, Components, Composite Structure, Packages, Deployment)
        - **behavior (dynamic) diagrams** --> describe how the elements of the system interact (e.g. Activity, Communication, Interaction, Sequence, State, Timing, Use Cases)

    - **UML Diagrams**:
        - **Use Case Diagram** --> represents system functional requirements using use cases, actors, and their relationships

        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.43.15.png>)

        - **Class Diagram (key diagram)** --> shows a set of classes, interfaces, and collaborations with their relationships (classes define common features of a group of objects)

        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.48.12.png>)

        - **Object Diagram** --> shows objects and their relationships at a specific point in time (represents an instance of a class diagram)

        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.49.28.png>)

        - **Component Diagram** --> describes the components of an application, their interrelations, and public interfaces

        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.50.38.png>)

        - **Interaction Diagrams**:
            - **Sequence Diagram** --> models the order of messages between system participants
            - **Communication Diagram** --> shows object organization and message passing between them
        
        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.51.49.png>)

        - **State Diagram** --> describes the states an object can be in and transitions between them (useful for showing complex class behavior)

        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.53.34.png>)

        - **Deployment Diagram** --> shows the physical system architecture and how nodes are connected

        - **Package Diagram** --> displays the organization of system elements into packages
    
        ![alt text](<imgs/Screenshot 2025-01-17 alle 17.56.02.png>)

        - **Object Constraint Language (OCL)** --> extends UML semantics with constraints and query expressions and describes:
            - **invariants** (in classes, types, or interfaces)
            - **preconditions and postconditions** (in methods)
            - **navigation schemes** for attributes and operations
